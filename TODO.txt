========================= IN PROGRESS =============================
- Use magic number static constexpr const auto ENIGMA_MAGIC_NUMBER = 0x454e49474d41; // "ENIGMA" at the start of each enigma cipher to detect validity before performing any operation.

- maybe store file extension in database aswell, can help recover file, pass extension with SaveFileDialog {"."}

- Encrypt & Decrypt Files using Chunks 
while(!eof())
	ifs.read(chunk_size, buff)
	cipher += encrypt(pass, buff)

- CPU Usage is not accurate on windows | https://github.com/BaderEddineOuaich/Enigma/issues/2

- CodeQL still doesnt ignore Dependencies


- Use ENIGMA_UNUSED [[maybe_unused]] instead of void for all std::system..etc to avoid warning: ignoring return value of ‘int system(const char*)’, declared with attribute warn_unused_result [-Wunused-result]


- disallow multiple enigma app instance,  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8799646/preventing-multiple-instances-of-my-application (DONE for Windows)

- Add copy button to output texts in DecryptTextScene & ViewEncryptionScene


- made encrypt/decrypt text compressed by default.


- remove json_type and add decltype()
https://github.com/BaderEddineOuaich/Enigma/blob/master/Source/Networking/CheckForUpdates.hpp#L55


- ViewEncryptionScene get only lightweight info about encryption until decryption made and retrieve other data.

- Maybe always detect algorithm from cipher, no need to make it an option

- always compress buffer before encrypting, remove --compress & --decompress CLI options as well as from readme


============================== DONE ===============================
- DONE Add Search textfield feature in MyEncryptionsScene  with Like %%
- DONE added VACUUM sqlite command to defragment disk
- DONE (issue was argv[0] returns enigma.exe only) Investigate why ENV doesnt work on CLI (it works when running it from local 
debugger with ui, but when calling cli, it doesnt seem to be set or get)
- DONE check why loadingscene's bg color doesnt work
- DONE LoadingScene if(scene.isLoading()) render it over main scenes.back()

- DONE ... on action performed (onclick..) spawn detached thread r scene's worker thread seperated from ui 
- DONE use crypto++'s base64 encoder/decoder
- DONE irrelevant lines
https://github.com/BaderEddineOuaich/Enigma/blob/master/Source/Application/Application.cpp#L298
- DONE Add CLI option --list to show encryption records
- DONE Add CLi option --save -s to database if selected, and --list to show all encryption records
- DONE fixed warning C4191: 'type cast': unsafe conversion from 'GLFWglproc (__cdecl *)(const char *)' to 'GLADloadproc'
- DONE remove const from non-reference returns in window & application to resolve gcc warning [-Wignored-qualifiers]
- DONE Encrypt file scene, use fs::path(dir) / filename + ".enigma"; instead
- DONE Add Database system to save encrypted text or maybe files too, user can export/import database
- DONE Add Algorithm::DetectFromBase64Cipher & DetectFromFile
- DONE Replace all ENIGMA_MB_TO_BYTES With ENIGMA_FRIENDLY_BYTES_SIZE 
- DONE check if it is possible not to use zlib with curl to reduce libraries links therefor small binary size [yes, only in windows, now zlib is linked for linux only]
- DONE fix typo https://github.com/BaderEddineOuaich/Enigma/blob/master/Source/Algorithm/AES/AES.cpp#L31
- DONE remove extra msg ,"please specify --mode..."
https://github.com/DanLangas/Enigma/blob/master/Source/Algorithm/Algorithm.cpp#L102
- DONE Perfrorm compressio by default, remove --compress and --decompress, aswell as Compress radio button
- DONE Investigate why GZip doesnt work,tests work but cipher compression is messed up over actual size.  (issue was i was compressing after encrypting which isnt right, see NOTES.txt)
DONE - Complete ViewEncryptionScene (decrypt text works, decrypt file doesnt yet) issue is the '\000' ate of string, when getting cipher blob from sqlite3, sqlite3 seem to add extra \000 to end of string https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35114277/ciphertext-length-is-not-a-multiple-of-block-size-in-cryptopp
- DONE Add README Notes hint (note: password is not saved) to Save to db [x]
- DONE Database records order by Size
- DONE On View encryption, get encryption from database by worker thread, it takes time to load, or maybe dont get the damn cipher until decrypt pressed to save memory
- DONE use EAX mode instead of CBC for algorithms with blocksize not equal to 16 (which GCM allows to be applied)
- DONE Remove annoying dialog asks to confirm abort operation on leaving encrypt decrypt scenes...
