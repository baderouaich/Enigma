========================= IN PROGRESS =============================

================ WRAP UP VERSION 1.4.0 ================
- Add Translation Language support 
French: Todo CLI, Algorithm exception messages, XOREncryptionTool
- Add RSA Algorithm, sign and verify in encrypt or decrypt
// Generate or Load keys
RSA::PrivateKey privateKey;
RSA::PublicKey publicKey;
...

RSASS<PSSR, SHA1>::Signer signer(privateKey);
// Create signature
...

RSASS<PSSR, SHA1>::Verifier verifier(publicKey);
// Verify signature on message
...

================ WRAP UP VERSION 1.4.0 ================



- Fix images do not appear in docs readme page https://badereddineouaich.github.io/Enigma/md__r_e_a_d_m_e.html

- System & Hardware Information Tool, Tree nodes (CPU DONE, RAM DONE, OS DONE, Displays DONE, Kernel DONE, Connected HIDs DONE, GPU Waiting for major OpenGL GPU Info impl)

- Fix memory leak caused by ImGui::InputText & ImGui::InputTextMultiline Clipboard past large buffer doesnt get freed entirely.

- My Encryptions table, display date as Jun, 01 2021 instead of 06 01 2021 SQLite does not support month names, sadly. You will have to convert it to a month name either using a lookup table, a case statement, or a switch on the presentation layer.

- CodeQL still doesnt ignore Dependencies, since paths-ignore codeql only supports python & js, remove it with .github/codeql/codeql-config (i might keep it if by chance they added support to c/c++ in the future, who knows?)

- Use magic number static constexpr const auto ENIGMA_MAGIC_NUMBER = 0x454e49474d41; // "ENIGMA" at the start of each enigma cipher to detect validity before performing any operation.

- maybe store file extension in database aswell, can help recover file, pass extension with SaveFileDialog {"."}

- Encrypt & Decrypt Files using Chunks (what if file is too huge and can be loaded entirely in memory?)

- maybe go further on new updates available, download update, extract binary to "."

- ability to cancel check-for-updates ui

- add to search utils myencryptions to search encryptions between two dates (or even direct sql query?)

- use enum ColumnFlags { ID = 1 << 0, TITLE = 1 << 1,...}; to filter what columns to get from database instead of compile time constexpr booleans for readability

- Maybe uplaod enigma release to stores like windows store and linux in such as https://www.linux-apps.com/ for global usage as a free open source project

- Add donate github or menu option (very low priority) if user wants to buy me a coffee.

============================== DONE ===============================
- DONE Add Search textfield feature in MyEncryptionsScene using sql like clause
- DONE added VACUUM sqlite command to defragment disk
- DONE (issue was argv[0] returns enigma.exe only) Investigate why ENV doesnt work on CLI (it works when running it from local 
debugger with ui, but when calling cli, it doesnt seem to be set or get)
- DONE check why loadingscene's bg color doesnt work
- DONE LoadingScene if(scene.isLoading()) render it over main scenes.back()

- DONE ... on action performed (onclick..) spawn detached thread r scene's worker thread seperated from ui 
- DONE use crypto++'s base64 encoder/decoder
- DONE irrelevant lines
https://github.com/BaderEddineOuaich/Enigma/blob/master/Source/Application/Application.cpp#L298
- DONE Add CLI option --list to show encryption records
- DONE Add CLi option --save -s to database if selected, and --list to show all encryption records
- DONE fixed warning C4191: 'type cast': unsafe conversion from 'GLFWglproc (__cdecl *)(const char *)' to 'GLADloadproc'
- DONE remove const from non-reference returns in window & application to resolve gcc warning [-Wignored-qualifiers]
- DONE Encrypt file scene, use fs::path(dir) / filename + ".enigma"; instead
- DONE Add Database system to save encrypted text or maybe files too, user can export/import database
- DONE Add Algorithm::DetectFromBase64Cipher & DetectFromFile
- DONE Replace all ENIGMA_MB_TO_BYTES With ENIGMA_FRIENDLY_BYTES_SIZE 
- DONE check if it is possible not to use zlib with curl to reduce libraries links therefor small binary size [yes, only in windows, now zlib is linked for linux only]
- DONE fix typo https://github.com/BaderEddineOuaich/Enigma/blob/master/Source/Algorithm/AES/AES.cpp#L31
- DONE remove extra msg ,"please specify --mode..."
https://github.com/DanLangas/Enigma/blob/master/Source/Algorithm/Algorithm.cpp#L102
- DONE Perfrorm compressio by default, remove --compress and --decompress, aswell as Compress radio button
- DONE Investigate why GZip doesnt work,tests work but cipher compression is messed up over actual size.  (issue was i was compressing after encrypting which isnt right, see NOTES.txt)
DONE - Complete ViewEncryptionScene (decrypt text works, decrypt file doesnt yet) issue is the '\000' ate of string, when getting cipher blob from sqlite3, sqlite3 seem to add extra \000 to end of string https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35114277/ciphertext-length-is-not-a-multiple-of-block-size-in-cryptopp
- DONE Add README Notes hint (note: password is not saved) to Save to db [x]
- DONE Database records order by Size
- DONE make encrypt/decrypt text compressed by default.
- DONE On View encryption, get encryption from database by worker thread, it takes time to load, or maybe dont get the damn cipher until decrypt pressed to save memory
- DONE use EAX mode instead of CBC for algorithms with blocksize not equal to 16 (which GCM allows to be applied)
- DONE Remove annoying dialog asks to confirm abort operation on leaving encrypt decrypt scenes...
- DONE always compress buffer before encrypting, remove --compress & --decompress CLI options as well as from readme
- DONE Logging instead of [date time] Enigma:  make it [date time] info: or [date time] warn... and more detaied in file
- DONE use templates in StringUtils instead of writing functions each cases
- DONE Maybe always detect algorithm from cipher, no need to make it an option when decrypting.
- DONE Enable file drop in Encrypt & Decrypt Files using glfwSetDropCallback(onFiledropcallback);
- DONE [USING SOCKETS] Prevent multiple enigma app instances
- DONE [RESOLVED] CPU Usage is not accurate on windows https://github.com/BaderEddineOuaich/Enigma/issues/2
- DONE Add Password Generator Tool
- DONE Add Hashing Tool
- DONE Make algorithm intent bitwise based so an encryption algorithm can be created for both intentions
- DONE Check why in docs u cant view file contents for example:  go to https://badereddineouaich.github.io/Enigma/class_check_for_updates.html and click CheckForUpdates.hpp, fixed by adding .nojekyll file to docs/ . see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25320356/can-i-have-my-github-pages-index-html-in-a-subfolder-of-the-repository
- DONE Remove spacing between TreeNodes in System & Hardware info tool CPU -> Quantities..
